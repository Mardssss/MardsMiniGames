# MardsMiniGames

MardsMiniGames is a Bukkit plugin designed to provide multiple mini-games within Minecraft servers. Currently, the plugin offers a simple "Catch" mini-game, where players can engage in a thrilling pursuit to catch and evade each other. This repository serves as the foundation for expanding the collection of mini-games, for developers to create and integrate new and exciting minigames.

Feel free to contribute to this project by providing new mini-games or enhancements! You can contact me on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/mard2364) to collaborate on ideas.
